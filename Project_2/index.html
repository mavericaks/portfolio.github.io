        <h2>1. Problems in Nature: Iteration, Recursion, and Backtracking</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Iteration:</strong> Iteration is seen in nature through repetitive cycles that continue over time. For example, the cell division process, where mitosis repeatedly splits cells to ensure growth and reproduction. Additionally, the seasonal migration patterns of animals, such as birds flying back and forth between regions, follow an iterative pattern. The water cycle also demonstrates iteration with repeated phases of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Recursion:</strong> Recursion appears in nature through self-similar structures. For example, trees exhibit recursive branching patterns, where each branch splits into smaller branches, similar to how each step in a recursive function calls the same function again with modified parameters. The process of DNA replication also demonstrates recursion, where the DNA strand unzips and each strand guides the creation of its complementary strand. In the plant kingdom, the Fibonacci sequence often governs the arrangement of leaves, flowers, and seeds, representing recursive growth patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Backtracking:</strong> Backtracking is common in problem-solving processes, such as animals foraging for food. When a path turns out to be unfruitful, animals retrace their steps and choose another direction. The immune system also uses backtracking; if an initial immune response fails to fight an infection, the system tries alternative strategies. Another example of backtracking in nature can be seen in climbing plants, which grow and adjust direction when they encounter an obstacle or when the initial path isn't optimal.

        <h2>2. Space and Time Efficiency: Significance and Growth Orders</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Definition and Importance:</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Efficiency</strong> measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to solve a problem. Time complexity is crucial to determine how well an algorithm scales as the size of the input grows.</li>
                <li><strong>Space Efficiency</strong> focuses on the amount of memory an algorithm requires. For large datasets or systems with limited memory, choosing algorithms that use minimal space is vital to prevent performance degradation.</li>
            </ul>
            The choice between time and space efficiency often involves trade-offs. For example, an algorithm that minimizes space usage might use more time, while one that prioritizes speed could require more memory.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Orders of Growth:</strong> The time complexity of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. Some common growth rates are:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>O(1)</strong>: Constant time; the algorithm's runtime is unaffected by the input size (e.g., accessing an array element by index).</li>
                <li><strong>O(log n)</strong>: Logarithmic growth, which occurs in algorithms that halve the search space at each step (e.g., binary search).</li>
                <li><strong>O(n)</strong>: Linear growth, meaning the runtime increases directly in proportion to the input size (e.g., iterating through an array).</li>
                <li><strong>O(n log n)</strong>: Linearithmic growth, found in efficient algorithms like merge sort and heapsort.</li>
                <li><strong>O(nÂ²)</strong>: Quadratic growth, typical in algorithms with nested loops (e.g., bubble sort).</li>
                <li><strong>O(2^n)</strong>: Exponential growth, where the problem size doubles with each step (e.g., brute force solutions to problems like the traveling salesman problem).</li>
                <li><strong>O(n!)</strong>: Factorial growth, seen in algorithms that evaluate all permutations (e.g., solving the traveling salesman problem through brute force).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>3. Design Principles: Chapter 2 Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decomposition:</strong> Breaking a problem into smaller, manageable pieces. For example, in the zombie children problem from Lab 01, the solution was divided into tasks like detecting zombies and mapping their behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Identifying repeated structures in problems. For instance, Indian fort designs often follow recurring patterns in layout and defense mechanisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Focusing on important features while ignoring irrelevant details. In Lab 01, the shapes of objects were abstracted, focusing on their size, position, and relationships, while ignoring colors and textures.</li>
                <li><strong>Cautious and Bold Travel:</strong> This refers to graph traversal strategies: <strong>DFS</strong> dives deep into a graph's nodes, while <strong>BFS</strong> carefully explores the graph layer by layer, ensuring that all nodes at one level are visited before moving to the next.</li>
                <li><strong>Pruning:</strong> Cutting off branches of computation that lead to dead ends. In the N-Queens problem, invalid placements are eliminated early to avoid unnecessary calculations.</li>
                <li><strong>Memoization and Pre-computation:</strong> Storing intermediate results to avoid redundant work, such as storing Fibonacci numbers that have been previously calculated.</li>
                <strong>Lazy Propagation:</strong> Postponing updates until absolutely necessary. This technique is used in data structures like segment trees, where changes are applied only when a query or update operation specifically demands them.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>4. Trees and Optimization Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Binary Trees:</strong> Simple structures where each node has at most two children. Used for basic hierarchies but lacks self-balancing.</li>
                <li><strong>Binary Search Trees (BSTs):</strong> Binary trees with ordering properties, allowing for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion. However, they can become unbalanced and degrade to O(n) in performance if not balanced.</li>
                <li><strong>AVL Trees:</strong> Self-balancing binary search trees that automatically adjust to maintain O(log n) height, improving efficiency. This involves rotations, which can add overhead during insertions and deletions.</li>
                <li><strong>Red-Black Trees:</strong> A balanced tree similar to AVL but uses color-coding to maintain balance, requiring fewer rotations and hence offering better performance in practical scenarios.</li>
                <li><strong>Tries:</strong> Specialized for string operations, especially for dictionary and prefix-based queries, by organizing data in a tree where nodes represent common prefixes.</li>
                <li><strong>Heaps:</strong> Efficient priority queues where the largest or smallest element can be accessed in O(1) time, with inserts and deletions occurring in O(log n) time.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>5. Array Query Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
            Efficient data structures and algorithms can optimize common array operations:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lookup Table:</strong> Using a precomputed table for fast lookups, reducing time complexity to O(1) but requiring more memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Segment Trees:</strong> Provide an efficient way to answer range queries and perform updates in O(log n) time, especially useful in problems that require repeated range queries or updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Sparse Table:</strong> An array preprocessed for constant-time range queries. Ideal for static data where no updates are necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Fenwick Trees:</strong> Used to compute prefix sums and provide efficient range queries and updates in logarithmic time.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>7. Sorting and Searching Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Sorting Algorithms:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bubble Sort:</strong> Simple but inefficient with O(nÂ²) time complexity, primarily used for educational purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Quick Sort:</strong> Efficient with average O(n log n) complexity. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach and is typically faster than merge sort in practice, though its worst-case complexity can be O(nÂ²).</li>
                <li><strong>Heap Sort:</strong> Also O(n log n) but generally slower than quicksort because of the overhead of maintaining the heap structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linear Search:</strong> Checks every element in the array, with a time complexity of O(n). It's simple but inefficient for large datasets.</li>
                <li><strong>Binary Search:</strong> Assumes a sorted array and reduces the search space in half each time, with O(log n) time complexity.</li>
                <li><strong>Hashing:</strong> Uses a hash function to directly map keys to values for O(1) average lookup time.</li>

        <h2>8. Graph Algorithms: Spanning Trees and Shortest Paths</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Spanning Trees:</strong> A spanning tree connects all vertices in a graph with the minimum number of edges.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primâs Algorithm:</strong> Starts with a node and grows the minimum spanning tree (MST) by adding the smallest edge connecting a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside.</li>
                <li><strong>Kruskalâs Algorithm:</strong> Sorts edges by weight and adds them to the MST, ensuring no cycles are formed. This is often more efficient in sparse graphs.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Shortest Path Algorithms:</strong> These algorithms find the shortest path from a starting vertex to all other vertices in a graph.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dijkstraâs Algorithm:</strong> Efficient for graphs with non-negative weights, finding the shortest path in O(V + E log V) time using a priority queue.</li>
                <li><strong>Bellman-Ford Algorithm:</strong> Can handle negative edge weights and detect negative weight cycles, with a time complexity of O(VE).</li>
                <li><strong>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:</strong> Computes all-pairs shortest paths, but with O(VÂ³) complexity, making it suitable for smaller graphs.</li>

        <h2>9. Algorithm Design Techniques</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Break problems into smaller sub-problems. Example: Merge Sort divides the array into halves and recursively sorts them before combining them.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Store solutions to sub-problems to avoid redundant work. Example: Fibonacci series, where each value is computed once and stored for future use.</li>
            <li><strong>Greedy:</strong> Make locally optimal choices to achieve a globally optimal solution. Example: The Huffman coding algorithm minimizes the total weight of encoded symbols.</li>
            <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Explore all possibilities and retract paths when a solution is not feasible. Example: Solving the N-Queens problem, where the algorithm backtracks after finding an invalid solution.</li>
            <li><strong>Branch and Bound:</strong> Prune ineffective paths early to save computation. Example: The traveling salesman problem, where paths that exceed the current best known path are discarded.</li>
            <li><strong>Randomized Algorithms:</strong> Introduce randomness for simplicity or efficiency. Example: QuickSort, where the pivot is chosen randomly to improve performance.</li>
